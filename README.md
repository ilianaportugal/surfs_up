## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze temperature trends in Oahu. We decided to focus on the months of June and December, pulling the summary statistics of each month. This analysis will help in determining whether a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year round.

## Results

- The months of June and December have standard deviations of 3.26 and 3.75 respectively. December has a higher variation in temperatures.
- Both the analysis for the month of June and December have high counts, this provides us with greater confidence as to the accuracy of the data. The count for June is 1700 and the count for December is 1517.
- When comparing the mean temperatures for June and December the difference is small, almost 4 degrees. June has a mean temperature of 74.94 and December has a mean temperature of 71.04.

## Summary
Based on our results I am confident this business venture will be sustainable year round. December and June have similar mean and max temperatures. Our data suggests that the weather is still warm during the month of December. I would still suggest running a query to analyze all months, there may be a rainy season we would want to account for. I would also like to run a query to analyze the summary statistics for the precipitation data for each month.
